A lightweight utilities library for .NET applications.

### Features
- A UBJson framework
- A subscription-listener framework
- An extensibility framework; for ease of loading plugins/extensions.
- And a ton of extensions/utilities

More features will be added soon, as I'm pretty busy at the moment.
